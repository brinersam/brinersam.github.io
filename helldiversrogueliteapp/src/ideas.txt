ai vision to import config from divers screenshots or whatever
tier list so u can tier weapons urself which will affect rarity or whatever
resources that u "gather" through gameplay to spend on guns / rerolls / idk
end of mission screen wehre u input ur stars / whatever to affect something on app
download/parse data from wiki (? is it rude)

theme themed tokens: tokens that limit selection to things
sniper
shieldman
nukeman
engineer tf2
melee samurai
supportman
bulldozer pd2
stealth man
mech operator
tank operator
artillery man
demoman tf2
cowboy

if one of two offered weapon is ASS u get some cool currency for picking it (used for rerolls or smth idk)
